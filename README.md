# 🌐 AECS Club Website – Built with Nuxt 3, Vuetify & Tailwind CSS

Welcome to the official repository for our club website!

This project is built using a modern front-end stack that allows us to develop fast, responsive, and maintainable web experiences:

## 🧠 Nuxt 3

[Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) is a powerful framework built on top of Vue 3. It offers:

- File-based routing
- Auto imports
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation

Nuxt helps keep our codebase clean and scalable while offering powerful features out of the box.

## 🎨 Vuetify

[Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) is a Vue UI library that follows Google’s Material Design principles. It provides ready-to-use, customizable components like:

- Buttons
- Navigation bars
- Cards
- Dialogs

With Vuetify, we can build a polished and professional UI quickly and consistently.

## 💨 Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing traditional CSS, we use small, reusable utility classes directly in our templates to style elements. This enables:

- Faster prototyping
- A more consistent design system
- Easy customization

---

Together, Nuxt 3, Vuetify, and Tailwind CSS make a powerful and flexible front-end stack that supports clean code, responsive design, and great user experiences.
